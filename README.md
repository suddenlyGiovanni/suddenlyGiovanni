Thank you for checking my GitHub profile!

I also have a brand new [blog][website] where I explore software engineering and *functional programming* within the confines of *TypeScript*.


These are also useful links to find out more about [who I am][about-me], my [RÃ©sumÃ©][resume], or what [motivates me][motivations].
