Thank you for checking my GitHub profile!

I also have a brand new website where I explore software engineering and _functional programming_ within the confines of _TypeScript_.

These are also useful links to find out more about [who I am][about-me], my [RÃ©sumÃ©][resume], or what [motivates me][motivations].
